This project proposes a modification to the q-learning algorithm which promotes increased exploration with no cost to the agent. We introduce the idea of "free time" and train a model to learn when it has free time to explore and when it does not. We call it "leisure learner"!. 

For more information on the method, please read the PDF in this repository.
